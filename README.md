My name is Avery Brock, and I am currently a Freshman at the University of Idaho majoring in Electrical Engineering. I have
been interested in electronics and science from a very young age and I have participated many robotics events including the 
MATE ROV competition and FIRST FRC. 


# Arduino-Pocket-VU-Meter
WS2812 matrix and Arduino Pro-Mini pocket insert

This project is based on Adafruit's VU tie project but adapted to a LED matrix. Original project design was for the 
SparkFun Electronics 'Electrify your Prom' contest. This meter is designed to take the place of a pocket hankerchief.
Original design uses a 2*10 WS2812 LED matrix mounted behind frosted polycarbonate and perforated Aluminium and runs off of
two AAA batteries. See linked YouTube video for more details and accompanying project. https://youtu.be/FtzGb0rgvxo
