My name is Avery Brock and I am currently a Freshman at the University of Idaho majoring in Electrical Engineering. I have
been interested in electronics and science from a very young age and I have participated many robotics events including the 
MATE ROV competition and FIRST FRC. In my spare time I like to tinker and work on random projects which I hope to document and publish more often then I have been. 


# Arduino Pocket VU Meter
WS2812 matrix and Arduino Pro-Mini pocket insert

This project is based on Adafruit's VU tie project but is adapted to a LED matrix. Original project design was for the 
SparkFun Electronics 'Electrify your Prom' contest. This meter is designed to take the place of a pocket hankerchief as everything is better with LEDS.
Original design uses a 2*10 WS2812 LED matrix mounted behind frosted polycarbonate and perforated Aluminium and runs off of
two AAA batteries. See linked YouTube video for more details and accompanying tie project. https://youtu.be/FtzGb0rgvxo
